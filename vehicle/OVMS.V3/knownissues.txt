Open Vehicle Monitor System v3 - Known issues

* Wifi APCLIENT mode is to be considered experimental.

* SSH, TELNET, and WEBSERVER all register listeners for incoming calls. There
  is a possible security issue here as those calls may come over cellular
  networks (not just wifi). There is no firewalling of these calls. It seems
  that the correct approach to this is to validate the destination IP to
  make sure it is a wifi interface IP address; but this is not currently
  done.

* Bluetooth is not currently supported.

* Vehicle: Tesla Roadster limitations (vs 2.x):
  * Cooldown not currently supported.
  * Charge timer not currently supported.
  * Charge time predictor not currently supported.
  * VDS vehicle errors not currently supported.
  * Digital speedometer feature not currently supported.

* Vehicle: Kyburz not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Mitdubishi iMiev not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Think City not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Volt/Ampera not currently implemented in 3.x.

* Vehicle: Renault Zoe not currently implemented in 3.x.

  Note that scripting can go someway towards providing equivalent functionality.
